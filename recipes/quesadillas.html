<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><ul>
    <li>6 flour tortilla (8-inch), warmed</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese (about 6 ounces)</li>
    <li>2 medium green onion, sliced (about 1/4 cup)</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p><li>Step 1

    Top half of each tortilla with 1/4 cup cheese, 2 teaspoons green onions and 1 tablespoon salsa.  Brush the edges of the tortillas with water.  Fold the tortillas over the filling and press to seal.</li>
<li>Stir together olive oil, garlic, herbs, and juice of 1/2 lemon. Spoon over salmon fillets being sure to rub all over the tops and sides of the salmon so it has no dry spots. Thinly slice remaining 1/2 of lemon and top each piece of salmon with a slice of lemon.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the quesadillas and cook in batches until lightly browned on both sides and the cheese is melted.  Serve with the remaining salsa.</li>
