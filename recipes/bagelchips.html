<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Make crispy, salty bagel chips with your stale, day-old bagels! These bagel chips are heavy on the garlic, and the real Parmesan cheese and Italian herbs give them a hearty flavor for satisfying snacking. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p><ul>
    <li>1/3 cup olive oil, plus more for greasing the sheet</li>
    <li>3 day-old bagels</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p><li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
<li>Use a serrated knife to slice bagels into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
<li>Stir olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and Italian seasoning together in a small bowl. Brush flavored oil mixture onto bagel rounds or use a spoon to drizzle over top. If you start to run out of the mixture, you can add a little bit more oil without sacrificing any flavor. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until chips are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. The chips will become crispier as they cool.</li>
